# ArnoldC

When I heard there was an esoteric programming language based on Arnold Schwarzenegger's famous one-liners, I knew I had to try it out. This repository is all about exploring ArnoldC, combining my interests in programming, bodybuilding, and the iconic personality of Arnold himself.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through setting up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before running the ArnoldC programs, you need to have Java installed on your machine, as ArnoldC is written in Java and compiles to Java bytecode.
### Installing

Follow these steps to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   Open your terminal and use the following Git command to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JumpiiX/ArnoldC.git
   cd ArnoldC

2. **Navigate to the `src` directory:**

   This directory contains the ArnoldC source files.

   ```bash
   cd src

3. **Compile and run an ArnoldC program:**

```bash
java -jar ../ArnoldC.jar hello.arnoldc
